        Once upon a time, there was a program that took two integers (a and b) as input from the user. The program performed different operations based on the values of a and b.
        If a was greater than 100 and b was greater than 10, the program printed a is above 100 and b is above 10.If this condition was not satisfied,
        the program checked if a was greater than 50 and b was greater than 50, in which case it printed a is above 50 and b is above 50. If this condition also didn't match,
        the program checked if a was greater than 20 and b was greater than 100, and printed a is above 20 and b is above 100 if this condition was met. If none of these conditions were met,
        the program simply printed None. */
